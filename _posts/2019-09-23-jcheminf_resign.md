# My Resignation from Springer's Journal of Cheminformatics

I am resigning from the Editorial Board for J. Cheminformatics on principle as I can no longer work with any Springer company.
Over the last two years I tried to explore working with Springer in a constructive manner and wrote many mails, but they were all ignored.
In any case this coincides with increasingly unacceptable practices from Springer which would have precipitated my resignation.

I have the highest regard for all the editors of J Cheminf and have been proud to be working with them. 
However Springer (along with a number other capital-driven companies) are now doing immense harm to world knowledge and global science. 
I believe that scholars (in and outside academia) should make a complete break and take part in an equitable global 
approach to the dissemination of public research and scholarship.

To give a simple example, anyone (like me) outside funded academia has to pay an APC of ca 1800 Eur to publish a paper in J.Cheminf. 
I cannot afford this and so am debarred from publishing in the Journal that I have committed to for over 10 years. 
Only the rich can publish. The system of waivers is demeaning and many in the Global South will not enter the process. 

I also believe that the price (APC) is totally unrelated to the cost of production (review, editing, typesetting, mounting). 
The base cost of this is ca 10 USD as shown by arXiv, J Machine Learning Research, and many others. In a competitive market the 
individual costs can be separated and selected as required. This is done by Arpha (Pensoft) arphahub.com who offer a finely 
grained set of services whereby the costs of publication range from 60 (sic) - 700 Eur. In contrast Springer simply quote a 
block "APC" of 1800 with no indication of how it was arrived at.

The same (only at a higher price) is shown by the recent Springer-DEAL(DE) transformative agreement where APCs are 2750  Eur/ paper. 
Since Springer's failed IPO indicated that their business intention was to increase the APCs as much as possible (for market/brand, 
not cost-related) I assume that APCs for BMC journals will continue to rise sharply.

Since Springer ignored my mails, my simple analysis of the 1800 Eur APC is:
* 600 costs (see above)
* 600 corporate management
* 600 profits for shareholders 

I do not see why any scholar should contribute their time to such an inequitable enterprise.

The Northern model of publishing is causing a deep divide with the Global South. The GS can either read-for-free (APC) 
or author-for-free (subscription) - it cannot do both. This is both inequitable and counterproductive as the world 
(facing global challenges) increasingly needs full involvement of all countries and scientists. 
Moreover the North is promoting the values of revenue greed (through "branding") rather that the dissemination of science. 
This is shown by the continued lazy sterile publication of PDFs, the lack of any interest in readers (either human or machine) 
and the inefficiencies of the competitive journal rather than innovations such as Jean-Claude's OpenNoteBook science. 
The industry is decades away from publishing re-usable open semantic datuments. When I joined J Cheminf the Editorial Board 
was a valued component and frequently consulted. There was considerable innovation.
The current publishing industry stifles innovation.
